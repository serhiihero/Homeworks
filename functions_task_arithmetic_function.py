# 1. Write an arithmetic function that takes 3 arguments:
# the first 2 are numbers, and the third is the operation to be performed on them.
# If the third argument is +, add them up;
# if -, then subtract; * - multiply; / - divide (first to second).
# Otherwise, return the string Not known operation: {operation}.
# Describe the function in the attached file in such a way that all checks in the __main__ task_1 block are performed correctly.
# DO NOT CALL THE FUNCTION YOURSELF I HAVE ALREADY DONE THIS IN "assert" STATEMENTS
